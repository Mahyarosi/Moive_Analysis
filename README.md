This project focuses on performing a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a public movie dataset [Kaggle,](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mjshubham21/movie-dataset-for-analytics-and-visualization). The primary goal is not just to clean data, but to uncover non-obvious trends and relationships that inform strategic decisions, such as budget planning, genre targeting, and expected revenue returns.
